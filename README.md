## Features & Hints

- Supports continuous scanning.
- Supports iOS 11 (only in Safari via HTTPS --> see `Limitations` below).
- There is a configurable delay of 1500ms after each successful scan, before a new QR-Code can be detected.
- Nice devs behind it. ðŸ¤“

## How To

**We've built a veeeery cool Wiki for you! [Click here to take a look!](https://github.com/zxing-js/ngx-scanner/wiki)**

I promise that it's **very** simple to use:
```html
<!-- some.component.html -->
<zxing-scanner></zxing-scanner>
```


## API

| Method              | Parameters                                     | Returns                          | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **changeDevice**    | `device: MediaDeviceInfo`                      | `void`                           | Allows you to properly change the scanner device on the fly. |
| **camerasFound**    | `callback: (devices: MediaDeviceInfo[]) => {}` | `EventEmitter<MediaDeviceInfo >` | Emits an event when cameras are found.                       |
| **camerasNotFound** | `callback: (): void => {}`                     | `EventEmitter<void>`             | Emits an event when cameras are not found.                   |
| **scanSuccess**     | `callback: (result: string): void => {}`       | `EventEmitter<string>`           | Emits an event when a scan is successful performed.          |
| **scanFailure**     | `callback: (): void => {}`                     | `EventEmitter<void>`             | Emits an event when a scan fails.                            |
| **scanError**       | `callback: (error: any): void => {}`           | `EventEmitter<any>`              | Emits an event when a scan throws an error.                  |
| **setCodeType**     | `CodeTypes | CodeTypes[]`                      | `void`                           | Sets the code types you want to read. Default is `'qr'`      |


## Performance

Read our performance notes on the wiki: [Performance Considerations](https://github.com/zxing-js/ngx-scanner/wiki/Performance-Considerations).


## Limitations

- On iOS <= 11.2 devices camera access works only in native Safari. **This is limited WebRTC support by Apple.**


## Generator
